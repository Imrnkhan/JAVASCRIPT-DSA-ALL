// How to play Sudoku

// The goal of Sudoku is to fill in a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, row, and 3×3 section contain the numbers between 1 to 9. At the beginning of the game, the 9×9 grid will have some of the squares filled in. Your job is to use logic to fill in the missing digits and complete the grid. Don’t forget, a move is incorrect if:

// Any row contains more than one of the same number from 1 to 9
// Any column contains more than one of the same number from 1 to 9
// Any 3×3 grid contains more than one of the same number from 1 to 9
// You are given a 2d array (basically 9 rows containing 9 numbers in each row). The numbers can be in the range of [0-9] (both inclusive). The presence of 0 in the matrix implies that particular cell is empty in the given sudoku.

// Write an algorithm that takes the 2d array (sudoku) in input and generates the filled sudoku in output


// Input
// The input has 9 lines and each line has 9 space separated integers between [0-9]


// Output
// Print the filled sudoku. Instead of the 0 present in the input, replace it with any other value from [1-9] that is correct for the sudoku

// **If there is no solution for the given sudoku, print -1 only**


// Sample Input 1 

// 0 4 0 0 0 0 1 7 9 
// 0 0 2 0 0 8 0 5 4 
// 0 0 6 0 0 5 0 0 8 
// 0 8 0 0 7 0 9 1 0 
// 0 5 0 0 9 0 0 3 0 
// 0 1 9 0 6 0 0 4 0 
// 3 0 0 4 0 0 7 0 0 
// 5 7 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 
// 9 2 8 0 0 0 0 6 0
// Sample Output 1

// 8 4 5 6 3 2 1 7 9 
// 7 3 2 9 1 8 6 5 4 
// 1 9 6 7 4 5 3 2 8 
// 6 8 3 5 7 4 9 1 2 
// 4 5 7 2 9 1 8 3 6
