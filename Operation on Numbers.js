// Operation on Numbers Ended
// Description

// You are given a number, stored in a variable with the namenumber. Perform the following operations on the value stored in the number

// 1. Multiply the value by 3
// 2. Add 7 after it
// 3. Subtract 10 from it
// After performing all the above operations, print the updated value


// Input
// The first and the only line of the input contains the number, stored in the variablenumber

// Constraints

// 1 <= N <= 30


// Output
// Print a single integer, denoting the updated value of the number stored, after performing all the operations, given in the problem statement


// Sample Input 1 

// 4
// Sample Output 1

// 9
// Hint

// In the sample test case, the value stored in the variablenumberis 4.

// After multiplying the value by 3, the value gets updated to 12

// After that, we add 7 to it, so the number gets updated to 19

// Finally, we subtract 10 from it, so the value becomes 9, which is the final output
