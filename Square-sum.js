// Square and Sum Ended
// Description

// You are given three numbers, stored in variables with the following names
// one, two, three
// You have to find the square of the three numbers, and find the sum of their square values
// Note : Square of a number, is a number multiplied by itself. For example, the square of 3, is 3 * 3 = 9


// Input
// The first and the only line of the input contains, the values stored inone, two, three

// Output
// Print the sum of the squares of the values stored inone, two, three

// Sample Input 1 

// 1 2 3
// Sample Output 1

// 14
// Hint

// In the sample test case, the value stored inone = 1, two = 2, three = 3.

// The square of the values stored will be

// one = 1 * 1 = 1

// two = 2 * 2 = 4

// three = 3 * 3 = 9

// The resultant sum becomesone + two + three = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14, which is the required answer.
