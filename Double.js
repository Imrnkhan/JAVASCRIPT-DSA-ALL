// Double all Ended
// Description

// You are given five numbers, stored in the variables with the following names

// one, two, three, four, five

// All the values are doubled, that is, they are multiplied by 2

// Find the sum of the values stored inone, two, three, four, after the above operation are performed


// Input
// The first and the only line of the input contains the values stored in variablesone, two, three, four, five

// Output
// Print the sum of the values stored inone, two, three, four,five, after the required operation is performed

// Sample Input 1 

// 1 2 3 4 5
// Sample Output 1

// 30
// Hint

// In the sample test case, the values stored in the variables are as follows

// one = 1, two = 2, three = 3, four = 4, five = 5

// After doubling all the values, the values become

// one = 1*2 = 2

// two = 2*2 = 4

// three = 3*2 = 6

// four = 4*2 = 8

// five = 5*2 = 10

// Therefore, the sum becomes2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30, which is the required output
